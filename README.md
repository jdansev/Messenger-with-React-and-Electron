# Messenger-with-React-and-Electron






My 3 Year Journey Developing a fully-featured instant messenger from scratch


The motivation for this project came to me during my senior year of university. I'd use FaceBook's Messenger to chat with friends a lot, and I wondered how challenging would it be to make something similar?

Doing my research it needed to be built in two parts--

Frontend: The UI itself, I planned to go all out making the sleekest user experience, complete with a stylish interface, popout menus and satisfying user interactions.


Backend: Should support real-time chat, storing message histories, registration and login, etc. This was the challenge, as I've never dabbled too much in the backend space.




### Growing Pains, and the Intro of React

As the UI grew in complexity, I started adding more and more functionality that suddenly meant including more tabs, screens, and menus options, etc. My TypeScript code soon became overloaded with unmaintainable code. At this point I realized I would  need of modern framework to accomodate the existing structure if it could ever hope to get bigger. That's when I discovered React, and it's component-driven architectural approach would be the perfect solution.  I decided to commit to learning this new framework and even purchased a course on Udemy, with the intention of rewriting the entire frontend of this project.

I divided each part of my UI into manageable chunks.



### Frontend
* React + Redux
* Electron

### Backend
* Go
