# Messenger-with-React-and-Electron



## My 3 Year Journey Developing An Instant Messenger From Scratch


The motivation for this project came to me during my senior year of university. Facebook's Messenger was how everyone on campus communicated, and I dared to wonder how challenging would it be to build something similar.

It started as a concept in my head.

Doing some research, it needed two parts--

Frontend: The UI itself, I planned to go all out making the sleekest user experience, complete with a stylish interface, popout menus and satisfying user interactions.


Backend: Should support real-time chat, storing message histories, registration and login, etc. This was the challenge, as I've never dabbled too much in the backend space.



As an ambitious student, oblivious to the headaches that come with projects of this magnitude, I deemed it doable and began this project.

### The Start of the Journey


### Growing Pains, and Introducing React

As the UI grew in complexity, more functionality gave rise to more menu options, more tabs and more screens. At one point I was writing code with the job of deleting a HTML section, and replacing it with another HTML section, all for a tab change. I was basically writing my own framework, things only became more chaotic. I was writing myself into a wall of unmaintainable code that would be the project's demise.

At this point I realized I needed a modern framework more organization and structure, that could accomodate the existing project structure.



That's when I discovered React. It's component-based approach was the perfect solution. And because React is a library and not a framework, I could incorporate it in bits and pieces without doing a full project overhaul.



I divided each part of my UI into manageable chunks.



### Frontend
* React + Redux
* Electron

### Backend
* Go
