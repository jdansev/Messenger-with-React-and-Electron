# Messenger-with-React-and-Electron



# My 3 Year Journey Developing An Instant Messenger From Scratch


The motivation for this project came to me during my senior year of university. Facebook's Messenger was how everyone on campus communicated, and I dared to wonder how challenging would it be to build something similar.

It started as a concept in my head.

Doing some research, it needed two parts--

Frontend: The UI itself, I planned to go all out making the sleekest user experience, complete with a stylish interface, popout menus and satisfying user interactions.


Backend: Should support real-time chat, storing message histories, registration and login, etc. This was the challenge, as I've never dabbled too much in the backend space.



As an ambitious student, oblivious to the headaches that come with projects of this magnitude, I deemed it doable and began this project.


### Growing Pains, and Introducing React

As the UI grew in complexity, I started adding more and more functionality that suddenly meant including more tabs, screens, and menus options, etc. My TypeScript code soon became overloaded with unmaintainable code. At this point I realized I would  need of modern framework to accomodate the existing structure if it could ever hope to get bigger. That's when I discovered React, and it's component-driven architectural approach would be the perfect solution.  I decided to commit to learning this new framework and even purchased a course on Udemy, with the intention of rewriting the entire frontend of this project.

I divided each part of my UI into manageable chunks.



### Frontend
* React + Redux
* Electron

### Backend
* Go
