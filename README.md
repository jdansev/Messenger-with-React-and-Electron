# Messenger-with-React-and-Electron


This project uses React, Typescript, and Electron for the frontend. The server is built with Go.






This project is intended to demonstrate a full-stack project using a modern and scalable tech stack.




As the UI grew in complexity, I started adding more and more functionality which suddenly meant more tabs, screens, and menus options-- my TypeScript code soon became overloaded with unmaintainable code. At this point I realized the dire need of modern framework to accomodate my existing structure if it was going to get any bigger. Then I discovered React, and it's component-driven architectural approach was the perfect solution to this problem. I could divide each part of my UI into manageable chunks. I recently decided to commit to learning React and purchased a course on Udemy, with the intention of recoding the frontend of this project.
